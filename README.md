Case

#So if we create an algorithm which says no to everyone, then the accuracy will be 37104/40000 which is %92.76
#So our baseline will be 0.9276 accuracy and we will try to beat this accuracy.

#Our final accuracy is %93. The recall and the precision values might change for the group who makes the purchase ("yes" group has less sample) So, smoothing percentage might change the recall and precision value for the "yes" group.

#Duration time is very critical for the customer's decision. If more information given to the customer on the cellular, the sales might increase. There isn't any significant difference between the jobs.
